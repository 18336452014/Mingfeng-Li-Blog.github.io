          ## 2. Dashboard Design

          The dashboard follows a **top-down storytelling flow** from summary to detail, reflecting the decision-making process of business users:

          - **Leadership Snapshot First:**  
            Starting with **KPI cards** and **high-level charts** (Sector and People leaderboards), leadership users get a **quick health check** on overall bid performance.

          - **Cause-and-Effect Middle Section:**  
            The second section shifts focus to **root cause analysis** (Bid Status, Loss Reasons, Sector Benchmarks).  
            This answers the key business question:  
            *"Why are we winning or losing?"*

          - **Detailed Drill-Down Last:**  
            The final layer includes the **interactive Bid Records Table**, empowering analysts to **explore specific bids for case-by-case reviews**.

          - **Interactivity Built-in:**  
            Throughout the dashboard, I implemented **slicers for Date Range, Sector, Price Bucket, People, and Bid Status**, allowing users to **customize views in real time**.

          This layout ensures that **each user group gets exactly the level of detail they need, in the order they prefer to consume it**.

          This structure mirrors **real-time business conversations** and decision-making processes.

          ✅ **Root Cause Visibility:**  
          The **loss reason pie chart** and **sector benchmarks** help teams **focus on actionable areas for improvement** (e.g., training, pricing strategies).

          ✅ **Performance Benchmarking:**  
          The **sector comparison with target lines** makes **underperformance immediately obvious**, prompting corrective actions.

          ✅ **Individual Accountability:**  
          **People Leaderboards** motivate performance by **showing who’s excelling and who may need additional support**.

          ✅ **Profit Impact Tracking:**

          ✅ **Flexible Interactivity:**
